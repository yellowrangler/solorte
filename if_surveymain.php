<td><p>Today, each medical entity that you receive care from only has records of your visits to their facility.  And depending on a facility's 
record keeping ability, only your recent medical history may be accessible. They will rarely have any medical information derived from other health
 care providers.  The medical staff will ask you questions about your prior care and, if you remember everything, they will proceed to determine the
 diagnosis, treatment and prescription for your ailment from their present observation.</p>

<td><p>Your financial history is maintained with more care and diligence.  Anytime you apply for a loan, or cash a check, your financial status is 
reviewed in detail. The medical industry does not manage your health care information with the same precision.  HealthYourSelf intends to remedy this 
imbalance by providing a service that will aggregate and  manage your medical records.</p>
